# zignolz-notebooks-public
This repository hosts the public and educational Jupyter notebooks used in Zignolz. It contains step-by-step examples, tutorials, and simplified versions of the models and tools we use to analyze S&amp;P 500 companies. All notebooks are designed to be opened directly in Google Colab, making them easy to explore, modify, and learn from.
